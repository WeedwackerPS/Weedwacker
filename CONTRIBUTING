Any contributions, small and large are welcome.
The code has to be understandable, and not hardcode any values whenever possible (ie. when it can be found in the resources).
Code written in c++, lua, and any .NET languages may be accepted, as long as they don't make the repo less cross-platform

Target exactly one thing with each PR.
Avoid overlap/conflicts with other open pull requests.
Duplicate pull requests will not be considered. Consider making an enhancement after the original PR is merged
